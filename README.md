# Conv-LSTM for Real-Time Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Crowd Behavior in Public Spaces
This project focuses on **real-time violence detection** in video datasets using deep learning-based visual models.  
Two benchmark datasets were used for experimentation:

1. **Real-Life Violence Situation Dataset (RLVS)** – for initial evaluation.  
2. **Hockey Fight Dataset (HFD)** – for final model validation.

The models were trained to differentiate between violent and non-violent actions using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning strategies.
